JAVA PROGRAMMING FOR MAINFRAME APPLICATIONS                      DAY 5                                                                            17/09/2022



Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.
Symbol Value
I 1
V 5
X 10
L 50
C 100
D 500
M 1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written 
as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the 
numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is 
before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, 
which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:
ï‚· I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
ï‚· X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
ï‚· C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.
Example:
Input: s = "III"
Output: 3

4. You are given an m x n binary matrix mat of 1's (representing soldiers) and 0's (representing 
civilians). The soldiers are positioned in front of the civilians. That is, all the 1's will appear 
to the left of all the 0's in each row.
A row i is weaker than a row j if one of the following is true:
The number of soldiers in row i is less than the number of soldiers in row j.
Both rows have the same number of soldiers and i< j. Return the indices of the k weakest 
rows in the matrix ordered from weakest to strongest.
Example 1:
Input: mat = 
[[1,1,0,0,0],
[1,1,1,1,0],
[1,0,0,0,0],
[1,1,0,0,0],
[1,1,1,1,1]], 
k = 3
Output: [2,0,3]
Explanation: 
The number of soldiers in each row is: 
- Row 0: 2 
- Row 1: 4 
- Row 2: 1 
- Row 3: 2 
- Row 4: 5 
The rows ordered from weakest to strongest are [2,0,3,1,4].
Example 2:
Input: mat = 
[[1, 0, 0, 0],
[1, 1, 1,1],
[1, 0, 0, 0],
[1, 0, 0,0]], 
k = 2
Output: [0,2]
Explanation: 
The number of soldiers in each row is: 
- Row 0: 1 
- Row 1: 4 
- Row 2: 1 
- Row 3: 1 
The rows ordered from weakest to strongest are [0, 2, 3, 1].




5. Develop a programme that uses Multiple Inheritance concepts to compute a student's grades 
in six subjects. The total and aggregate are then calculated, and the student's grade is 
displayed. If the student achieves an aggregate of more than 75%, the grade is Distinction. If 
the aggregate is between 60 and 75, the grade is First Division. If the aggregate is between 50 
and 60, the grade is Second Division. If the aggregate is between 40 and 50, the grade is 
Third Division. Otherwise, the grade is FAIL.
